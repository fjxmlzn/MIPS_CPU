WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   alu1/cmper/ctrl[2]_PWR_208_o_Mux_15_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <peri1/Mram_TX_buffer1_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
